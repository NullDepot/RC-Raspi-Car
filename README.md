# RC-Raspi-Car
The Raspi-Car project is the creation of a remote-controlled car that can be operated using a headless Raspberry Pi set up. This project takes advantage of a live video stream using MJPG Streamer in order to control the car over the network without needing to maintain a line of sight on the car itself.
